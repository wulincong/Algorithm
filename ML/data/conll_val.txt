30	The	Republic	of	Ireland	's	new-look	side	dispelled	painful	memories	of	their	last	visit	to	Liechtenstein	by	beating	the	Alpine	part-timers	5-0	in	a	World	Cup	qualifier	on	Saturday	.	0	5	6	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	7	8	0	0	0	0
36	The	Irish	,	under	new	manager	Mick	McCarthy	,	took	a	4-0	lead	within	20	minutes	through	captain	Andy	Townsend	,	20-year-old	Norwich	striker	Keith	O'Neill	,	Sunderland	forward	Niall	Quinn	and	teenager	Ian	Harte	.	0	7	0	0	0	0	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	2	0	0	3	0	1	2	0	3	0	1	2	0	0	1	2	0

41	The	result	helped	erase	memories	of	Ireland	's	visit	to	the	Eschen	stadium	14	months	ago	,	when	Jack	Charlton	's	side	were	held	to	a	frustrating	0-0	draw	which	ultimately	cost	them	a	place	in	the	European	championship	finals	.	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	7	0	0	0

40	Springbok	scrum-half	Joost	van	der	Westhuizen	was	his	side	's	inspiration	,	scoring	their	opening	try	and	making	the	third	for	flanker	Andre	Venter	from	a	quickly	taken	penalty	to	give	his	side	a	29-8	lead	after	54	minutes	.	3	0	1	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

44	A	quick	penalty	from	Van	der	Westhuizen	five	metres	from	the	All	Black	line	set	up	the	third	try	for	Venter	five	minutes	later	and	when	Joubert	kicked	his	third	penalty	the	Springboks	held	an	unassailable	32-8	lead	going	into	the	last	quarter	.	0	0	0	0	1	2	2	0	0	0	0	3	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

49	Brazilian-born	Luis	Oliveira	then	gleefully	slipped	the	ball	past	goalkeeper	Rustu	Recber	from	the	right	of	the	area	to	make	it	2-0	seven	minutes	before	the	interval	,	Turkey	's	best	first-half	effort	proving	to	be	a	vicious	30-metre	shot	by	Ogun	Temizkanoglu	which	De	Wilde	tipped	over	.	0	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	2	0	1	2	0	0	0
